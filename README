For more information about the usage please see src/kolabformat.h

= Building =

Build with:

$mkdir build
$cd build
$cmake ..
$make

Library installation path:

LIB_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/lib

Set the installation prefix:

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

Installation location for header files:

INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/include

Building of bindings can be controlled using cmake configuration options:

PHP_INSTALL_DIR
JAVA_INSTALL_DIR
CSHARP_INSTALL_DIR

=== Example ===

Find libraries in lib64, install to /usr/lib64, build python and phpbindings:

$cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DLIB_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/lib64 -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=TRUE -DPYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/lib64/python$x.$y/site-packages/ -DPHP_BINDINGS=TRUE ..
