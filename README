= About =

Libkolabxml is the reference implementation of the Kolab XML Format as
defined in http://wiki.kolab.org/User:Mollekopf/Drafts/KEP:17.

It provides serialization/deserialization from/to in-memory
representations for all Kolab Objects, including input validation.

= Bindings =

Based on SWIG (www.swig.org) various language-bindings are provided.

= Usage =

For more information about the usage please see src/kolabformat.h

= Building =

Build with:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

== CMake options ==

Options can either be supplied on the commandline or edited in the
cmake cache.

Library installation path:

    LIB_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/lib

Note that LIB_SUFFIX is honored since version 1.0.2

Set the installation prefix:

    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

Installation location for header files:

    INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/include

Building of bindings can be controlled using cmake configuration
options:

    PYTHON_BINDINGS
    PHP_BINDINGS
    JAVA_BINDINGS
    CSHARP_BINDINGS

The path to install the bindings:

    PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR
    PHP_INSTALL_DIR
    JAVA_INSTALL_DIR
    CSHARP_INSTALL_DIR

=== Example ===

Find libraries in lib64, install to /usr/lib64, build python and
phpbindings:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DLIB_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/lib64 \
    -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=TRUE \
    -DPYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/lib64/python$x.$y/site-packages/ \
    -DPHP_BINDINGS=TRUE ..
