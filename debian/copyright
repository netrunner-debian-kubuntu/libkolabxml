 The files included say that they are "not copyrighted - public domain".
 .
 However the upstream package that generates them lists the following
 license. (http://codesynthesis.com/projects/xsd/)
 .
 1. Intent
 .
 We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS") to be
 able to use the specified GPL-licensed XSD runtime library (libxsd) and
 XSD generated code (collectively called the "Program") despite the fact
 that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU
 General Public License (the "GPL").
 .
 It is our intent to allow distribution of the entire Derivative Work
 (including the Program) under one or more of the FLOSS licenses listed
 in section 3 (section 2.a). It is also our intent to disallow simple
 relicensing of the Program for the sole purpose of using it in
 proprietary applications (section 2.b and 2.c). As an example, consider
 two hypothetical scenarios:
 .
  a) You created a program that uses the XSD generated code and the XSD
     runtime library to access information in XML instance documents.
     Your program performs useful computations based on this information
     (sections 2.b and 2.c are satisfied). You distribute your program,
     including the XSD generated code and the XSD runtime library under
     the BSD license and make it available at no charge to all third
     parties (section 2.a is satisfied). Later you (or someone else) may
     choose to base their proprietary application on your code since the
     BSD license does not prohibit it.
 .
     This scenario falls under this FLOSS Exception.
 .
 .
  b) You created a library that uses the XSD generated code and the XSD
     runtime library to access information in XML instance documents. You
     did not add to the library any other useful code that uses the XSD
     generated code or the XSD runtime library (neither section 2.b nor
     2.c is satisfied). You distribute your library, including the XSD
     generated code and the XSD runtime library under the BSD license and
     make it available at no charge to all third parties (section 2.a
     is satisfied). Later you base your proprietary application on this
     library since the BSD license does not prohibit it.
 .
     This scenario does not fall under this FLOSS Exception (neither
     section 2.b nor 2.c is satisfied). You created the library for the
     sole purpose of making the XSD generated code and the XSD runtime
     library available to your proprietary application.
 .
 .
 2. Legal Terms and Conditions
 .
 As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2 of
 the GPL you are free to distribute a verbatim copy of the Program
 as part of the Derivative Work that is formed from the Program or
 any part thereof and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") as
 long as you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
   a) You must cause the Derivative Work that in whole or in part
      contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
      to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
      under the terms of one or more of the licenses listed in
      section 3.
 .
   b) The Derivative Work should contain one or more FLOSS Work that
      can be reasonably considered as derived from the Program or some
      part thereof.
 .
   c) The Derivative Work should not contain any part of the Program
      that cannot be reasonably considered as a base of one or more
      FLOSS Work.
 .
 .
 3. FLOSS License List
 .
   a) Any license listed in the "GPL-Compatible Free Software Licenses"
      and the "GPL-Incompatible Free Software Licenses" sections of the
      License List as published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF):
 .
      http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html
 .
 .
 4. Definitions
 .
 Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in
 the GPL.
 .
 Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.
 .
 .
 5. Applicability
 .
 You may choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under
 the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that
 copy of the Program.
